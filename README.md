# Mini Wagering Game App
This project is a basic React Native application developed using Expo, allowing users to authenticate, view a game card feed, participate in challenges, and integrate a live pedometer for tracking-based games.

## Features

### Authentication:
Users can sign up, log in, and log out using Firebase Authentication.

### Game Card Feed: 
Displays multiple game cards with titles, descriptions, and images.

### Game Details: 
Each game card links to a detailed view with specific game information and a "Join" button.

### Game Dashboard:
After joining a game, users can view game details and track steps using a live pedometer.

### Background Step Tracking:
Utilizes background tasks to continue step tracking even when the app is not in the foreground.
